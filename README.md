# 30Days-Javascript-Challenge
With this repository I've placed the things I like about the 30days javascript challenge by wesbos

## Why the Challenge?
When I'm coding I'm looking for stuff that is interesting some normal online boring courses doesn't work for me.
Thanks to wesbos I'm learning while creating cool stuff :)

### setup
I'm not focusing on creating the propper folders in this course such as scss folders, component folders etc.
This is just a quick setup to dive into javascript.
